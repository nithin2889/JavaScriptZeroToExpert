/**
 * Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs:
 * Synchronous code is the code that gets executed line by line.
 * Thread of execution is part of execution context which does actually execute the code
 * in the computer's processor. Each line waits for previous line to finish. This can create
 * problems when one line of code takes a long time to run. Ex: alert() - blocks the code
 * execution until we click the OK button.
 *
 * Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes. Ex,
 * setTimeout() function. Here, the main code is not blocked and execution does not wait
 * for the asynchronous timer to finish its work. This is the main difference between a
 * synchronous and asynchronous code.
 *
 * Another example would be setting the `src` attribute of the image and this is essentially
 * loading an image in the background while the rest of the code can keep running. This makes
 * sense if we image there is a huge image, we wouldn't want our entire code to wait for the
 * image to load. Once the image has finished loading, a load event would automatically be
 * emitted by JavaScript which we can listen to in order to act on it.
 *
 * Asynchronours behavior of a task like loading of an image or running a timer is what decides
 * the asynchronous state.

// Example:
// const img = document.querySelector('.dog');

/**
 * AJAX: AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, and allows us to communicate with the
 * remote web servers asynchronously.
 *
 * API: API stand for Application Programming Interface. Now, API is basically a piece of software
 * that can be used by another piece of software in order to basically allow applications to talk
 * to each other and exchange information.
 *
 * In web development, there are countless number of APIs like DOM API, Geolocation API, and also
 * Own class API where we make some methods available as a public interface. So these can be viewed
 * as a self-contained encapsulated pieces of software that other pieces of software interact with.
 *
 * The API that when we use AJAX can be called as "Online" APIs. An Online API is essentially an
 * application running on web server that retrieves the data from some database and then sends it
 * back to the client. When building applications in practice we call these online APIs, APIs.
 *
 * We can build our own web APIs but that requires back-end development. E.g: NodeJS or use third-party
 * APIs.
 *
 * API data format: XML is a data format which was used extensively previously. However, these days
 * basically no APIs uses XML data anymore. Most APIs these days use the JSON data format today because
 * it is basically just a JavaScript object but converted to a string.

/**
 * Promises and the Fetch API:
 * A promise is that is an object that is used basically as a placeholder for the
 * future result of an asynchronous operation.
 * OR
 * A promise is a container for an asynchronously delivered value.
 * OR
 * A promise is a container for a future value.
 *
 * Analogy: A promise is just like a lottery ticket. When we buy a lottery ticket
 * then essentially we buy some amount of money in the future if I guess the
 * correct outcome. The lottery draw will determine whether I will get the money or
 * not happens asynchronously. In case, I did get the correct outcome, then I will
 * receive my money because I have my lottery ticket which is the promise that I
 * bought.
 *
 * Advantage of using a promise:
 * 1. We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous
 * functions to handle asynchronous results. Events and callbacks can sometimes cause
 * unpredictable results which is a big win using promises already.
 * 2. Even better, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations
 * instead of nesting which allows us to escape the callback hell.
 *
 * Since promises work with asynchronous operations, they are time sensitive. They
 * change over time and so promises can be in different states. This is what we call
 * the lifecycle of a promise.
 *
 * Lifecycle of a promise:
 * 1. Pending: In the very beginning, we say that the promise is pending before any value resulting
 * from the asynchronous task is available. During this time, the asynchronous task is still
 * doing its work in the background.
 *
 * 2. Settled: When the task finally finishes, we say the promise is settled and there are two
 * different types of settled promises.
 * a. Fulfilled - A promise that is successfully resulted in a value just as we expect it.
 * b. Rejected - A promise that has some error during the asynchronous task.
 *
 * A promise is only settled once and so from there the state would remain unchanged forever.
 *
 * The fetch() function builds the promise and returns it for us to be consumed
 */

 * Consuming Promises returned by the fetch function:
 * The fetch function returns a promise which should be handled as part of the then() method.
 * To handle the fulfilled state of the promise we use the then() method that is available
 * on all promises. We pass a callback function into the then() method will be called as soon
 * as the result is available.
 *
 * From the response, we need the body attribute of the response which is basically a ReadableStream
 * which doesn't display any data. In order to read any data from the body, we need to call the
 * json() method on the response. The json() method is available on all the response objects
 * that is coming from the fetch() function.
 *
 * The json() function is also an asynchronous function that returns a promise itself. So what we
 * do is to return the response and handle it as part of another then() method.
 *
 * There is also finally() method and the callback that we pass in here will always be called
 * whatever happens (rejected or fulfilled) with the promise. We can use finally to start the
 * spinner when an asynchronous operation starts and stop it once the operation completes.
 *
 * The .finally() only works because the .catch() method also returns a promise.

/**
 * Asynchronous code behind the scenes: The Event Loop
 * JavaScript runtime is basically a container which includes all the different pieces
 * that are necessary to execute JavaScript code.
 *
 * The heart of every JavaScript runtime is the engine which is were our code is executed
 * and objects are stored in memory. JavaScript has only one thread of execution which can
 * do only one thing at a time. There is absolutely no multi-tasking happening.
 *
 * Next, we have Web API environment. These are the APIs provided to the engine, but are
 * not part of the JavaScript language itself. Things like DOM, timers, the fetch API,
 * geolocation API, so on and so forth.
 *
 * Next, there is a Callback Queue which is a data structure that holds all the ready to
 * be executed callback functions that are attached to some events that has occurred. Whenever
 * the callstack is empty, the event loop takes the callbacks from the callback queue and
 * puts them in the callstack so that they can be executed.
 *
 * The event loop is the essential piece which makes the asynchronous behavior possible in
 * JavaScript. Event Loop is the reason why we can have a non-blocking concurrency model in
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * A concurrency model is simply how a language handles multiple things happening at the same
 * time.
 *
 * How does event loop work?
 * It is in the Web APIs environment where the asynchronous tasks related to the DOM will run.
 * The same is true for timers, AJAX calls and really all other asynchronous tasks. If an image
 * was loading synchronously it will be loading in the execution context there by blocking the
 * execution of the rest of the code.
 *
 * When we are loading an image, JavaScript will emit load event which will be registered in
 * the Web API environment. Same is true with the fetch API. Finally, when we use the .then()
 * method on the promise returned by the fetch function, this also registers a callback in the
 * web API environment so that we can react to the future resolved value of the promise.
 *
 * Basically, we are assuming that an image is loading and data is being fetched asynchronously
 * behind the scenes. Now, let's say the image has finished loading and the load event is emitted
 * on that image. What happens next, is that the callback for this event is put into callback
 * queue. Callback queue is an ordered list of all the callback functions that are in line
 * to be executed. Just like a todo list.
 *
 * Now, the event loop looks into the call stack and determines whether it is empty or not except
 * off course for the global context. If the call stack is indeed empty, then it will take the
 * first callback from the callback queue and put it on the callstack to be executed. This is
 * called an event loop tick. We say there was an event loop tick each time the event loop takes
 * a callback from the callback queue. So we can say that the event loop does the orchestration
 * of this entire JavaScript runtime.
 *
 * Now, we still have the fetch() function getting data from the AJAX call in the background. With
 * promises, things work in a slightly different way. Now, assume the data has finally arrived and
 * the fetch is done. The promises method like then() registered in the Web API environment will
 * not go into the callback queue. They have a special queue for themselves which is the so called
 * microtasks queue. What special is they have priority over the callback queue. At the end of an
 * event loop tick, the event loop will check if there are any callbacks in the microtasks queue.
 * If there are any callbacks, then it will run all of them before it will run any more callbacks
 * from the callback queue. By the way, we call these callbacks from promises, microtasks and hence
 * the name microtasks queue.
 */
// Example code:
console.log('Test Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('0 second timer'), 0);
Promise.resolve('Resolved Promise 1').then(res => console.log(res));
Promise.resolve('Resolved Promise 2').then(res => {
  // for (let i = 0; i < 10000000000; i++) {}
  console.log(res);
});

/**
 * output:
 * Test Start
 * Test End
 * Resolved Promise 1
 * Resolved Promise 2 // takes some time to complete since it is on microtasks queue.
 * 0 second timer // won't execute until the microtasks queue callbacks complete their execution.
 *
 * This is because, all top level code executes first and then event loop checks the microtasks
 * queue for any promise related callbacks, giving it a priority over the regular callback queue.
