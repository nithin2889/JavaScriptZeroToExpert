/**
 * Here, the flight number is a string primitive value and as we passed that
 * value into the function then it is basically a copy of that original value.
 * This would be exactly the same as writing
 * => const flightNum = flight
 *
 * However, when we passed the object names `nithin` to the function and in
 * that function it is called passenger and we changed that passenger object
 * here. Here, the original object will also be affected by that change.
 * Because, when we pass just the reference type to the function what is
 * copied is really just the reference to the object in the memory heap.
 * This would be exactly the same as writing
 * => const passenger = nithin
 *
 * In summary, passing a reference type to a function is really just the same
 * as creating a copy as shown below outside of a function.
 * const flightNum = flight
 *
 * And when we pass an object to a function it is really just the same
 * as creating a copy of an object as shown below.
 * const passenger = nithin
 *
 * So whatever we change in the copy will also change in the original. Hence we
 * need to be careful before mutating an object in large code bases as it can
 * have unforeseeable consequences.
 *
 * In programming there are two terms that are used all the time when dealing
 * with functions, which is "pass by value", and "pass by reference". JavaScript
 * does not have passing by reference only passing by value.
 *
 * In C++, you can pass a reference to any value instead of the value itself.
 * This works even with primitives so you could pass a reference to the value
 * and then the original value outside of the function would be changed. This
 * is called as passing by reference. But JavaScript doesn't have passing by
 * reference. As we already saw above, for objects we do pass in a reference,
 * the memory address of the object. However, that reference itself is still
 * a value. It is simply a value that contains a memory address. So basically,
 * we pass a reference to the function but we do not pass by reference and this
 * is an important distinction.
 *
 * First-Class and Higher-Order Functions:
 * JavaScript's fundamental property is the fact that it has first-class
 * functions. This enables us to write higher-order functions.
 *
 * JavaScript is a language that has first-class functions which in technical
 * terms means that functions are so-called first citizens. In practice, that
 * means that functions are simply treated as values. JavaScript works this
 * way because functions are really just another type of objects in JavaScript.
 * And since objects are values, functions are values too and since functions
 * are values there are a bunch of interesting things that we can do with them
 * like storing them in variables or object properties, passing functions as
 * arguments into other functions (when we have the add event listener function
 * where we clearly passed the function as a value), we can also return a function
 * from another function.
 *
 * Just like there are methods inside many objects, like array methods, there are
 * also function methods - the methods that we can call on functions. For ex:
 * bind, call etc.
 *
 * Now, having functions as first-class citizens makes it possible for us to use
 * and write higher-order functions.
 *
 * Higher-Order Function:
 * 1. A higher-order function is either a function that receives another function
 * as an argument, or a function that returns a new function, or both.
 * For ex: A function receiving another function would be the addEventListener
 * function.

 * callback function and that's because the callback function will be called
 * later by the higher-order function.
 * Here, the addEventListener higher-order function will call the greet
 * function later as soon as the click event happens.
 * It's like the greet function saying, "Hey there, don't greet me yet,
 * but call me back once you are ready".

 * have. All it means is that all functions are values. There are no

/**
 * What this means is that the booker function was in fact able to increment the
 * passengerCount 3 times.
 *
 * But now if we think about this, how can the booker() function update this passengerCount
 * variable that is defined in the secureBooking() function that actually has already
 * finished executing? but the inner function is still able to access the passengerCount
 * variable that is inside the booker function. The booker still some how continues to
 * have access to the vriables that were present at the time that the function was created.
 * This is because of closure. Closure makes a function remember all the variables that
 * existed at the function's creation time. So here, secureFunction() is the birthplace
 * of the booker() function.
 *
 * What happens when we run the booker() function
 * 1. A new execution context is created and put on top of the call stack and the variable
 * environment of this context is empty simply because there are no variables declared in
 * this function.
 * What about the scope chain? Since booker() is in the global context it is simply a
 * child scope of the global scope. But now, how will booker() function access the passengerCount
 * variable?
 *
 * ***** VERY IMPORTANT *****
 * The secret here is, any function always has access to the variable environment of the
 * execution context in which the function was created. In case of booker(), it was born in the
 * execution context of secureBooking() function which is already popped off the stack
 * previously. Therefore the booker() function will get access to the variable environment
 * which contains the variable passengerCount variable and that is how the booker()
 * function will be able to read and manipulate the passengerCount variable and it is this
 * connection that we call as Closure.
 *
 * So closure is basically a variable environment attached to the function exactly as it
 * was at the time and place that the function was created. So in a sense the scope chain
 * was actually preserved through the closure. Even though the scope has already been
 * destroyed because the execution context is gone (secureBooking). So the variable
 * environment somehow keeps living somewhere in the JavaScript engine. Thanks to closure,
 * a function does not lose connection to variables that existed at the function's
 * birthplace.
 *
 * Now, when we run the booker() function it attempts to increase the passengerCount
 * variable. However, it is not present in the current scope. So JavaScript will immediately
 * look into the closure and see if it can find the variable there and it does this even
 * before looking at the scope chain. Even if there was a global passengerCount variable
 * in the global execution context set to some value, it would still first use the one
 * in the closure. So the closure basically has the priority over the scope chain. So after
 * increasing the passengerCount by 1, the execution context is popped off the stack and
 * so on.
 */
// In order to take a look at a closure in a console we can use console.dir.

// The internal property Scopes is what the variable environment of the booker function and
// we will be able to see the closure that is coming from the secureBooking() function.
// NOTE: Whenever we see double brackets in a function, that means it is an internal

// Also, you don't need to return a function from another function in order to create
